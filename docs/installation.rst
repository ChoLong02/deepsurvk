Installation

Stable release
--------------

To install DeepSurvK, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install deepsurvk

If you want to install a specific version, you can run the command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install deepsurvk==0.2.0

However, I recommend to always install the most recent (stable) release, since it probably has important bug fixes.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

The sources for DeepSurvK can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

Or download the `tarball`_:
